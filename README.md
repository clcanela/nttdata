# NTT Data - Drupal Hands-on Test

### Drupal version: 10.1
### PHP version: 8.1

No extra modules were installed

The list of movies on the Actor page is a rendered view on the preprocess_page hook,
no special module was needed

Created styles and template overrides for some CT. SCSS was used for CSS compiling but
shouldn't be needed

No special instruction for installing the project other than the standard Drupal
technical requirements
